# Chocolatey-install
Installs configured programs on a windows machine
```console
@powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://gist.github.com/marko-milasinovic/a2db484a46a105b2532a4c5325199a64"
```
Seeing how chocolatey repositories have to be manually maintained and can therefore lag behind the newest release (or even be abandoned), i've forgone using chocolatey as the main program installer.
